    <string name="manual_pt1">Take a photo in manual mode without the filter in an environment where the light doesn\'t change. Ideally there\'s no daylight and a constant artificial light source. Use a tripod to fix the camera.</string>
    <string name="manual_pt2">Now put on the filter and compensate for it by cranking up the exposure time by the factor the filter manufacturer claims. Don\'t change ISO and aperture!</string>
    <string name="manual_pt3">Take the photo and compare the histograms. They should look identical. If they don\'t, repeat step 2 with increased or decreased shutter speed until they do.</string>
