        <b><big>v303</big></b>
        \n• Some tiny UI refinements and other under-the-hood enhancements

        \n\n<b><big>v302</big></b>
        \n• Landscape mode!
        \n• Added this changelog dialog.
        \n• Fix: The filter factor is now only allowed to be ≥ 1. A filter can\'t really increase the amount of light.

        \n\n<b><big>v301 – <i>initial release</i></big></b>
        \nVersion 3 is my third iteration in writing this app. A complete re-write! A different,
        better user interface! Performance first! More features than ever! And ultimately the first
        version that is openly available.
