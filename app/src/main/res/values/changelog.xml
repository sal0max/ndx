        \nâ€¢ Added this changelog dialog.
        \nâ€¢ Fix: The filter factor is now only allowed to be â‰¥ 1. A filter can\'t really increase the amount of light.
        \nâ€¢ Landscape mode! ðŸ¤™

        \n\n<b><big>v301 â€“ <i>initial release</i></big></b>
        \nVersion 3 is my third iteration in writing this app. A complete re-write! A different,
        better user interface! Performance first! More features than ever! And ultimately the first
        version that is openly available.
